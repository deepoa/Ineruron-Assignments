2. Now we will copy date from file1 to new file2
o cp file1.txt file2.txt
o Then see the output of file2.txt, cat file2.txt
o Give screenshot

ans 2: we use cp command for copying the file data from one file to another file cp file1.txt file2.txt we can do also cp -v file1.txt file2.txt for verbose output to see we -v do . so after that i have check the permisson to the fiels and change the permission to chmod 777 to execute and after running file2.txt cat file2.txt we get file1.txt data in file2.txt and
output image reference(891 and 892 png).

 3.Now we will move the file2.txt to new folder /home
o mv file2.txt /home

ans 3:  For moving file to directory we have to use mv filname and directory  but this is giving some permission error beacuse we don't have a permission to that so we have to with sudo with root user and with ls it is now showing anything but we have to do wiht ls -l /home for checking the file it exist or not.

content in it.

output of file3.txt
o Now do echo “Hello I am newline” >> file4.txt and provide the
output of file4.txt
