Assignment 4 : Let’s take a scenario of fintech app program in which we want to have three separate
outputs for 3 different situations:

The balance is less than zero
The balance is zero
 The balance is above zero
For instance, in the following program, use the if, elif, else statements to display different outputs in
different scenarios:

Use “if” condition to check if the balance is less than zero. If this condition evaluates to true, display
the message using the echo command: “Balance is less than zero, Please add more funds else you
will be charged penalty”.
If the above condition does not match, then use “elif” condition to check if the balance is equal to
zero. If it evaluates to true, display the message: Balance is zero, please add funds
If none of the above condition matches, use the “else” condition to display the: Your balance is
above zero.
